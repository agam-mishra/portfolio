					In my role as an Application Development Analyst, I took the initiative to leverage AWS CloudWatch to build a systematic notification system that automatically alerted the team whenever a service failed. This proactive monitoring solution allowed us to respond swiftly to issues, minimizing downtime and ensuring that critical services remained operational. By setting up tailored CloudWatch alarms and integrating them with real-time notifications, we were able to stay on top of any service disruptions and quickly resolve them, which ultimately contributed to maintaining system reliability and stability.

					Additionally, I played a key role in collaborating with the team to migrate from AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) to Webflow. This migration was crucial in streamlining the content creation process, as Webflow offered a more intuitive and user-friendly platform for content management. The transition allowed us to speed up content updates, improve collaboration among teams, and reduce the technical complexity associated with the previous system. By making the content management process more efficient, we were able to better meet business needs and adapt to changing requirements more quickly.
